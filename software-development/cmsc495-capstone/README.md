# CMSC 495 Capstone in Computer Science

## Project Overview
As the culmination of my Computer Science degree at the University of Maryland Global Campus, I completed a collaborative capstone project, developing a web application called **Maître d'** - a restaurant reservation management system. The project demonstrated my abilities in full-stack development, incorporating security best practices, and working effectively in a team environment.

## Academic Performance
- **Final Grade**: 99.65% (996.5/1000 points)
- **Course**: CMSC 495 7384 Capstone in Computer Science (2242)
- **Semester**: Spring 2024
- **Perfect Scores**: Achieved 100% on all discussion assignments, project phases, and major deliverables

## Project Highlights

### Maître d' Application
Our team developed a comprehensive restaurant reservation management system with the following key features:
- User registration and authentication for both diners and restaurant owners
- Restaurant profile management
- Reservation creation, modification, and cancellation
- Review system for dining experiences
- Secure user data management

### Project Phases and Deliverables
Our capstone project was completed in structured phases, each receiving exceptional scores:

1. **Project Plan (100/100)**: Developed a comprehensive plan aligned with PMBOK framework principles.
   
2. **Design Document (100/100)**: Created detailed structural, behavioral, and interactive diagrams using IEEE Standard 1471 for software architecture. Professor noted: *"This is an excellent design document. Your coverage of structural, behavioral, and interactive diagrams was complete."*

3. **User Guide and Test Plan (100/100)**: Produced comprehensive documentation following IEEE 829-2008 standards.

4. **Implementation Phases (148.5/150)**: Successfully implemented the application across three development phases with excellent code quality.

### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture**: Three-tier architecture using MVC design pattern
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java Spring framework
- **Database**: H2 Database
- **Security**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2 for authentication and authorization

## Professor's Evaluation Highlights

> "Team 3's Maitre d' application exemplifies stellar integration of components using advanced microservices like Spring JPA. The project's approach to a common restaurant reservation management system is commendable for its innovation and uniqueness. Your solution is lightweight, loosely coupled, and demonstrates tight integration through effective middleware and RESTful APIs utilizing JSON within the Spring framework."

> "Using the Java Spring application framework alongside HTML5 technologies (JavaScript, CSS, and HTML) facilitated rapidly decomposing requirements into an MVC design pattern. Choosing an H2 Database ensures robustness and resilience appropriate for your application needs."

> "The detailed traceability document effectively aligns functional activities with features and test cases supported by unique identifiers. This structured approach enhanced the development and traceability of user stories, clearly demonstrating how feature requirements are testable at both acceptance and unit levels."

> "Your testing strategy is commendably thorough, adhering to ISO standards for severity and status."

> "The design of a secure architecture from the UI to the backend is praiseworthy. Implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth2 permission levels reflects a sophisticated approach to security."

## Weekly Discussion Contributions
Throughout the course, I actively participated in weekly discussions, consistently receiving perfect scores and positive feedback from Professor Mentzos. Some highlights from these discussions include:

### Week 1: Project Management Methodologies
Identified key dilemmas between DevOps/Agile approaches and traditional project management. Professor noted: *"New to the game and you already have observed one of the most significant dilemmas facing project management."*

### Week 2: Multi-Channel Nonlinearity Mitigation
Provided a thorough analysis of the paper "Multi-Channel Nonlinearity Mitigation Using Machine Learning Algorithms." Professor commented on my *"enthusiastic and comprehensive overview"* and *"insightful analysis"* that effectively related the paper's findings to software development.

### Week 3: Developer Productivity in Blockchain
Authored "Harmonizing Innovation and Collaboration: A Blockchain Enthusiast's Perspective on Developer Productivity," exploring the SPACE framework in blockchain development. The professor appreciated my *"leadership on the discussion board this week."*

### Week 4: Computing Power and Demographic Analysis
Analyzed "The Effects of Increases in Computing Power on Demographic Analysis Over the Last 50 Years," providing personal reflections that added *"depth and insight to the discussion,"* according to Professor Mentzos.

### Week 5: Risk Factors in Open-Source Software
Reviewed research on risk factors in open-source software development, demonstrating *"clarity and coherence"* in communicating key findings and mitigations.

### Week 6: Quantum Internet Advances
Provided a *"succinct summary"* of quantum internet research that presented *"complex concepts in a clear and accessible manner,"* with emphasis on future cybersecurity implications.
